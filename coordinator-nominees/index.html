<p>You must be having this question in your mind :
*** Why should you vote for me, or what is that thing which make me different from others for the coordinator's position? ***</p>

<p>I am a part of many major committees and groups in IIITD like the Cultural Committee, Sponsorship Team and PR Team : Odyssey'17, IIITD MUN Organizing Team etc. which has given me a lot of Experience and Management Skills which are one of the most important things that a coordinator must have.</p>

<p>Also I believe in the concept of being a Leader, rather than a Boss. I believe in working with my team, and understanding their situations instead of just assigning work/task to them.</p>
<p>
I am a very creative person and have a lot ideas in my mind regarding how to create awareness about IIITD's ECell, how to generate funds etc. and would surely like to discuss with you people.</p>
Thank You.

Hey,<br> 
			<p>I am Gaurav Sachdeva of Cse. 2015 btach . I want to be the E-Cell Co-ordinator because according to be E-Cell in IIIT has a got a major role</p>
			<p>1. We first of all need to sustain the interests of the students who have shown interest in E-Cell by offering them guidance ,assistance in whatever way e-cell.can by providing mentorship funding to the budding startups n assistance in growth to the others.</p>

<p>2. I , being a co-founder of an ed-tech startup Ezyschooling can bring in a lot of experience in the operations beacuse i have experienced every aspect of it and have collaborations with all major schools in east -delhi .</p>
<p>3. I have an experience of team leader at aisec in corporate so i have decent enough contacts in startups in delhi ncr.</p>
<p>4. I can assure to revive and increase the interest and participation in ecell by conducting orientations , giving incentIves , ideathons , innovative events. Etc .</p>
<p>So I hope I can bring value to ecell and serve it as entrepreneurship is my passion</p>

<p>
	I am a 3rd year B.Tech, CSE undergrad who would like to promote and take the startup culture in our college to the next level. I plan to do this by organising hackathons for our college's startup founders in a similar setting as in Byld, the software development club. I want to build a thriving startup ecosystem in our college. I am also a member of FooBar Elite but I personally think that this entrepreneurship cell has potential to do better than Foobar and Byld clubs since we are actually applying the concepts taught at those clubs to solve real world problems.

Hello Guys,
<br>
<p>I am Manish Kumar Singh currently in 3rd Year B.Tech(ECE), I have a lot of experience in Startups and Entrepreneurship, in past I have worked in Startups and gained a lot of experience and made lots of Contacts. I have also participated in many Startup Events (organized by Google, IAMAI,YourStory, DTU,etc.. ) and know how to organize such events. I was also the Event head of RoboSoccer Event in ESYA, which was so successful that was even featured in Times of India.</p><p>
I have a great vision for our E-Cell, I have also thought many activities that we will conduct to encourage students to start their own Ventures. If you help me in becoming the coordinator of E-Cell I assure you I will make it the best and most active Club in IIIT Delhi. I also assure you that I will protect the rights of every E-Cell member and make it function in a very democratic way.
</p>
Thank You

<p>The name of this club itself excites me up. Being a part of the core team, i wish to share my ideas and debate on how to start a new venture for becoming entrepreneurs. A lot of ideas, related to small and medium business models, which keep rolling in my mind may get an outlet if i am given a chance to work for E-cell IIITD. I can also help in establishing a good relationship between E-cell IIITD and the industry to provide support to our would be "product providers" i.e. entrepreneurs. 
To share my ideas about new possible business ventures. Besides, i want my fellow colleagues to think seriously about the challenges faced in new business. In future, i also want to be a part of mentorship and guidance provider team through association with E-Cell, IIITD team. Adding to it, i want to excel in art of coping up with the challenges faced by entrepreneurs. The skill of networking with all kind of people can be best learnt here.</p>

Hello,<br> 
			<p>

I want to be a coordinator of E Cell as it makes me feel good and lively by coordinating and organising the events. I got energetic after doing such activities. I like to get involved in activities which require leadership qualities.
</p><p>
At school level, I used to be the monitor of my class, class in-charge of the respective house. During my graduation, I was the class representative for two years. Thus, I have leadership skills and also volunteer experience as I have volunteered and coordinated many events during the technical and cultural fest. I can represent students. I can motivate and energise members by connecting them with activities going on in E Cell, its purpose and goals.

			<p>Hello guys! As I said earlier, E cell can be be called anything. Be it "Extracting cell" to extract ideas from potential students and help them bring those ideas to reality or be it "Entrepreneurship Cell" - the evergreen name. All that matters is its job. I wanna head the coordinator post for E cell as I always had interest in Entrepreneurship and I think, I'll be able to bring in more members and keep the existing members satisfied with what the E cell has to offer. There are other factors as well like communication skills, decision making abilities,etc. I won't say I'm perfect at those, I have always been working on them but there's always scope for improvement.</p>
